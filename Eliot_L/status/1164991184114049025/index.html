  	      I recently learned the story of Lucius Beebe. He and his boyfriend Charles Clegg owned several luxurious private railway cars starting in the 50's. He was a journalist and noted fashionista who once appeared on the cover of life magazine. <a href="http://www.thegayalmanac.com/2017/12/born-today-in-1902-journalist-luscious.html">http://www.thegayalmanac.com/2017/12/born-today-in-1902-journalist-luscious.html</a> <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="../../tweets_media/1164989499073388544-ECrfxZfUcAAm3Qi.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1164989499073388544-ECrfxZfUcAAm3Qi.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
