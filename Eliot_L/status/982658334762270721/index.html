  	      @cuddigan @vectorpoem I worked somewhere where our fans reverse-engineered our binary format. It would have been so much easier for them if we had just released our editor. But nobody cared and I guess we didn't want the liability of doing anything to facilitate UGC due to copyright issues or w/e.

  	      @cuddigan @vectorpoem I think at some point they did release some technical documentation but in the early days of modding the community had to reverse engineer everything themselves. The fact that the engine used an external data file was more a design philosophy left over from Commander Keen.
