  	      @mcclure111 @vectorpoem the California budget works due to Prop 98, which he knew. We basically can't afford to pass single payer unless voters pass a new prop to override 98 exempting healthcare costs from the total budget used to calculate what % is legally required to go to K-12 education.

  	      @mcclure111 @vectorpoem so he (and I guess the other senators that voted for it) kinda threw Assembly Speaker Rendon under the bus because he kind of had no choice but to kill the bill after it passed the Senate. Anyway I like that he's more progressive than Feinstein but publicity stunts like that
