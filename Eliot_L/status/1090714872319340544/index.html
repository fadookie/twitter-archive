  	      PSA: #Podcasting hasn't yet been fully swallowed by tech giants. But it gets a little closer every time the RSS feed is hidden. Please put a link to your feed in a conspicuous location (like right next to your "Subscribe in X" buttons) to help keep the ecosystem healthy. Thanks!

  	      There are some tools that could help like FeedBurner. And many hosting platforms like SoundCloud actually have hidden RSS feeds that are visible to owners and can be extracted by listeners with some fiddling. But I think it's best not to treat the feed as a second-class citizen.

  	      I'm an Android user and I have been using an app called BeyondPod, which I paid for, to listen to podcasts for nearly a decade. It's made by an independent developer and allows me to download podcasts to listen offline. But I can't use it unless I can find the RSS feed. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a target="_blank" href="../../tweets_media/1090717230461968384-DyMBie4UwAAJQcv.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1090717230461968384-DyMBie4UwAAJQcv.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>
